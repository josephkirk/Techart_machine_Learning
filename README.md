### DIRT: a fast Differentiable Renderer for TensorFlow
#### https://github.com/pmh47/dirt
> DIRT is a library for TensorFlow, that provides operations for rendering 3D meshes. It supports computing derivatives through geometry, lighting, and other parameters. DIRT is very fast: it uses OpenGL for rasterisation, running on the GPU, which allows lightweight interoperation with CUDA.

### Fast and Deep Deformation Approximations
> Character rigs are procedural systems that compute the shape of an animated character for a given pose. They can be highly complex and must account for bulges, wrinkles, and other aspects of a character's appearance.This significant savings allows us to run the complex, film-quality rigs in real-time even when using a CPU-only implementation on a realtime application.
